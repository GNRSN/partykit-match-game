## Getting Started

First, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` in the project root.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, open the created `.env` file and fill in the missing environment variables.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the PartyKit development server at port **1999**, and a Next.js development server at port **3000**.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
